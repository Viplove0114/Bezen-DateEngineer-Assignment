a simple and easy way to playing with the big data with the help of pyspark lib. in python                                                          

the link to the data - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l6c8yalCJc_PwAytIKDc_LafnCQ5eFPb/view?usp=sharing                                           

#i also uploaded the requirement.txt file and problem statement also                                                                               

NOTE- if you are not able to create and start a new session of pyspark in  your local machine then use google colab (i faced the same problem and if anyone have the solution please contact me through email- viplovethakran4@gmail.com)
